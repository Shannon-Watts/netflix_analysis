# Netflix analysis ðŸ“º :tv:

This project was completed by Chisimnulia Okoye, Sofia Kauser, and Shannon Watts.

## Research proposal

Our project focuses on two datasets sourced from Kaggle. We chose these datasets as we love to watch Netflix ... but we had run out of tv shows and films to watch. We wanted to see how many of IMDBs top 1000 films and tv series were on Netflix. Surely the most rated and top grossing films are the most interesting? So we also wanted to know which films/tv shows and how many were not on Netflix. 

The Datasets:

We chose these datasets because we thought it would best illustrate what we wanted to find.

Research Questions:

How many of the worldâ€™s top grossing films are currently on Netflix?

What are the top grossing films which are on Netflix and what is there corresponding IMDB score?

What genres are the highest grossing films? And what genres are Netflix currently showing? Possible suggestions for films to be added next month?
